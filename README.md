## Overview

KudiTrace_AI_SRE_Platform is designed as a **robust, full-stack system** for monitoring and maintaining uptime-sensitive applications.  
The platform demonstrates **best practices in modern software engineering**, using multiple languages and frameworks to handle real-world performance, reliability, and observability challenges.

---

## Features

- Multi-language full-stack architecture:
  - **Frontend:** React + TypeScript for observability dashboards
  - **Backends:** Node.js, Go, Rust for API, microservices, and performance monitoring
- Detailed **progress logs** for development and system updates
- Built for scalability and maintainability
- Strong focus on **code readability, reliability, and modular design**
- Ready for **deployment and integration with modern CI/CD pipelines**
